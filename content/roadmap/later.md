## Later

Things we will be working on in the long term:

- Explore use of a 'utility' component to provide finer-grained control over layouts, spacing and media-specific targeting
- Seperate the Design System React components into a separate repository
- Incorporate official Australian Government Branding Implementation guidance into the design system documentation site
- Investigate using react component code to automatically generate version controlled sketch files.
