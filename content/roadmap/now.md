## Now

Things we are currently working on:

- Improvements to [`table`](https://designsystem.gov.au/components/table) component
- Add `pagination` component
- Simplify onboarding processes for designers, developers and product owners
- Expand template offerings to include [commonly-requested templates](https://community.digital.gov.au/c/designsystem/suggest-a-template) (for example, search engine result pages, media releases, etc.)
- Ensure common government CMS platforms can easily align with current versions of components and templates
