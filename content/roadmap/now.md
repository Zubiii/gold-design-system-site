## Now

Things we are currently working on:

- Expand template offerings to include [commonly-requested templates](https://community.digital.gov.au/c/designsystem/suggest-a-template) (for example, search engine result pages, media releases, etc.)
- Ensure common government CMS platforms can easily align with current versions of components and templates
