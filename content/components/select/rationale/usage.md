Select boxes (also known as drop-down lists) are provided for completeness, but should be avoided where possible.

Select boxes have several inherent disadvantages:

 - they are implemented inconsistently on various devices
 - they hide content from the user by default
 - they present usability difficulties for users with low digital literacy.
 
For most small lists (for example, choosing an Australian state or territory), consider using [radio buttons](/components/control-input/#radio), [checkboxes](/components/control-input/#checkbox) (where multiple selections are allowed) or [text inputs](/components/text-inputs/) instead.

In a scenario with a long list of options (for example, selecting a country), select boxes may provide an acceptable trade-off between usability and layout compactness.
