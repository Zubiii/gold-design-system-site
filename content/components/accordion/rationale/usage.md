heading: Using accordions
---

We recommend that accordions be used sparingly.  While they can be appropriate for organising small, specific sections of content, accordions are not a suitable replacement for well formattted plain text. If a user requires all, or most of the informmation on the page it should be visible, and not hidden inside an accordion. 

Issues highlighted by relying too heavily on accordions are that, 

**Hiding content makes it harder for a user to scan a webpage.** 

**Accordions increase cognitive load.**  

**Printing.**
