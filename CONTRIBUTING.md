## Content changes

We use a static site generator called [cuttlebelle](https://cuttlebelle.com/). This means that all of the content in our site lives in markdown files.

To contribute content we recommend first editing the files in the [content folder](https://github.com/designsystemau/design-system-site/tree/master/content).

You may want to undertake the [Cuttlebelle tutorials](https://cuttlebelle.com/documentation/) to get a better idea on how to create new pages and layouts.
